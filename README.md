Classic Pong arcade game 
This is a Pong game based on the original 1970s Atari video game. It is made to run on any computer running python. It will still retain the old school feel while making some cosmetic changes to make it feel a little more modern, such as color and a little different layout with the paddles and scoreboard.  

Edits that were made include:
Creating single paddle rather than two
Speeding up pace of the ball and paddle to make game more challenging
Updating scoring information along with user prompts
Changed design features of the game so that game was played vertically rather than horizontally
Changed color and graphics of paddle, ball, and background
Changed the desginated keys for movement of the paddle

Pong.py is created to be a single player game type that allows users the chance to reach high scores and compete against others.  Users will be prompted to restart the code when the game is finished and the final score will display.

# Owen/Greg New Section
Project Goals:
- I would like to tweak the movement of the paddle to have smoother handling
- Create boundaries for the paddle so it does not go off screen
- Create a "Winner" screen when player reaches certain score
